# Bitcoin Tracker


## User Story

AS AN amateur investor,
I WANT an application that shows the value of bitcoin in real time.
SO THAT I know how much it's worth at the time I view it for investment decisions. 


## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN I'm on the Bitcoin Tracker webpage, 
WHEN the page fully loads, 
THEN I can view the dashboard, 
   And the bitcoin price in real time on a chart for the last 30 days is displayed. 
   And the current bitcoin price and total number of bitcoin core releases is displayed. 

## Project Description

When you open the application, the Bitcoin Tracker will display the bitcoin price in real time and the current number of Bitcoin Core releases. The bitcoin price for the last 30 days will be displayed on a chart. The user can switch between a line chart or candlestick chart by clicking a button. There are three links provided on the website that link to brokerages that can be used to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The information provides users with another resource to use when researching investment opportunities in cryptocurrency. 

## Project requirements and technologies used

We used Skeleton as the CSS framework. The webpage deploys and works as it is intended to. The website is interactive and responds to user input through a change graph button. The user can click on links within the webpage that will bring them to investment websites. CoinGecko API is used to fetch the current Bitcoin data. GitHub API is used to fetch the current number of Bitcoin Core releases. A modal is used through the change graph button. Client-side storage is used to store data for the different graphs.
